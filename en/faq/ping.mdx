### **Ping (Connection Latency)**

**Ping** shows how many milliseconds it takes for a server to respond to a request. Lower value = faster and more stable connection. Remember: Ping reflects latency, not bandwidth.

---

#### **How to Check Ping**

**1) For an entire subscription**

1. Open the main screen.
2. Tap the speedometer icon in the header of the desired subscription.
3. The Ping for each server in that subscription will appear next to it.

**2) For an individual configuration**

1. On the main screen, swipe the configuration element to the right — an actions panel will appear.
2. Tap the speedometer icon — the Ping for this specific configuration will be displayed.

**3) For the current connection**

1. Tap **"Check Current Connection"**.
2. It will display:
   - Ping value in milliseconds (always **ms**);
   - **"Timeout"** error if unavailable.

#### **What Affects Ping**

- Server distance (closer = lower latency);
- Quality and load of your internet channel;
- Network and device load;
- Background processes (downloads, updates, etc.).

#### **Ping Types in Happ**

The app supports three measurement methods. They solve different tasks and may show slightly different results.

**ICMP Ping**

Checks basic network availability with ICMP packets (similar to the `ping` command).

- Requires **temporarily disconnecting the VPN tunnel**.
- Used less frequently due to inconvenience in daily use.

**TCP Ping**

Measures the time to establish a TCP connection to the server.

- **Does not require** disconnecting the VPN tunnel.
- May reflect latency to the **nearest CDN point** if the server uses a content network — so actual latency to the final node may differ.

**Ping via Proxy**

Measures latency **through the active VPN connection**, accounting for the entire path. This is the most indicative method for users.

**How the check works:**

1. The app resolves the server's domain name (if a domain is specified).
2. Establishes a TCP connection; performs TLS handshake if necessary.
3. The test resource's domain is resolved on the server side.
4. The server establishes a TLS connection with the target site (if HTTPS).
5. Measures the time to receive a response from the target resource.

**Advantages:**

- Accounts for encryption and the entire data route;
- Provides the most realistic latency value when working with VPN.

**Via Proxy Modes:**

- **Via Proxy GET** — used **by default**; standard HTTP request.
- **Via Proxy HEAD** — request without body; **slightly lighter** on servers.

#### **How to Change Ping Display Method**

**Path:** Settings → **Ping**

Two options are available:

- **Time (ms)** — precise latency value (e.g., _42 ms_).
- **Status Icon** — availability only:
  - green with checkmark — server is available;
  - red with exclamation mark — server is unavailable.

> The selected option is saved automatically and applies to all servers.

#### **Automatic Check on Launch**

The **"Ping on Launch"** feature checks the availability of all servers at once when opening the app — you immediately see the current status without manual testing.

**How to enable:** Settings → **Subscriptions** → enable **"Ping on Launch"**.

After activation, Ping is measured for all servers and their status is updated (response time or icon) every time the app launches.

#### **Usage Tips**

- Compare Ping **under identical conditions** (same network, similar device load).
- Repeat tests: one-off latency spikes are possible due to network overload.
- For assessing real user experience, focus on **Ping via Proxy**.
