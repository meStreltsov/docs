HWID links are subscriptions tied to a specific device. Verification is performed locally on the client side.

To create such a link, first obtain the device's HWID, then generate the link in your personal account.

HWID link creation is only available through [happ-proxy.com](http://happ-proxy.com).

#### **Creating via the website**

1. On the Link Limit page, select the HWID Links section.
2. Specify the unencrypted URL of your subscription.
3. Enter the HWID of the device for which the link is intended.

**After generation:**

- The HWID parameter is automatically added to the URL.
- You will receive an encrypted link.

#### **How it works**

When adding the link, the application compares the HWID in the link with the device's HWID. If they match, the link is added to the application.
